# Project Overview

Project Name: Scent Symphony - Mock Fragrance Blender

Description: A web application that simulates the experience of creating personalized fragrance blends. Users can explore a library of 200 mock scent notes, experiment with unique combinations, and visualize their custom creations using a radar chart. This project focuses on providing an engaging and intuitive frontend experience, with all backend functionality (scent blending algorithms, subscription management, etc.) convincingly mocked.

Features:
*   Interactive Scent Library: Browse a curated collection of 200 mock scent notes, categorized by fragrance family (floral, woody, citrus, etc.).
*   Drag-and-Drop Blend Builder: A user-friendly interface for combining scent notes. Users can adjust the "concentration" of each note in their blend.
*   Visual Blend Representation: A dynamic radar chart that visualizes the composition of the user's fragrance blend, highlighting the dominant scent profiles.
*   "Save" & "Share" Mock Blends: Users can "save" their favorite mock blends and "share" them with friends (via simulated social media links).
*   Subscription "Signup" Flow: Mock subscription tiers with varying benefits, showcasing potential monetization strategies.

Technology Stack:
*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
